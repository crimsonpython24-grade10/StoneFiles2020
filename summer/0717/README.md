**How to start**


1. Activate your virtual environment. There is not a npm command to run this due to operating system differences. There is a pip requirement file inside the project directory.
2. Have your virtual environment activated. Go into the projects directory and run `npm i_all` to initialize the project. Then run `npm rs` to have the server running (there are additional commands, full reference inside package.json).
